1)

whenever create a new project,
first conenct to psql
then creae a new database on port 5432
in database.url put the same name at the last 

then after creating the database table run the application

```cmd

PS C:\Users\anand\Downloads\spring-boot-data-jpa-hospital-management-system> psql -U postgres -d postgres
Password for user postgres:6591@Kiit
```




```cmd
postgres=# SELECT current_database();
 current_database                                                                                                                                                                                                                
------------------
 postgres
(1 row)


postgres=# CREATE DATABASE hospitaldb;
CREATE DATABASE
postgres=# 
```


```text
  
server.port=8084  
#DB configuration  
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/*hospitaldb*
spring.datasource.username=postgres **
spring.datasource.password=6591@Kiit

```




2)

when in my new project, 
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/*hospitaldb*

i simply kept this without 
entering the psql terminal and creaitng a database 

it showed error no such table exists 

then i changed the name to postgres which was also the name for my previous project 

and ddl was update so it added the schema of hospitals as well to  my previous postgres table of webrak 

so i now to correct either through sql run command i had to drop the tables 
or drop it from pgadmin4


or easy way i rebuild the project 





3)
in pg4 admin your each query runs in a database not the whole username as a whole 

you can see the  it above which database and username its running

4)in order to create ddl commands


 pg_dump -U postgres -d postgres --schema-only > schema.sql 

pg_dump -U postgres -d hospitaldb --schema-only > schema.sql 

			username databse of that user 


and in the directory where this command will run 

it will create a sql file where all the ddl commands will be there.
