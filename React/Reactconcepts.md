const hobbiesArray = useDynamicFieldArray(control, "hobbies");


lets understand what this useDynamicFieldArray does 

so useDynamicFieldArray is a custom Hook

defined under hooks/dynamicFieldArray

1. - Its job is to help you **manage an array of form fields dynamically** — i.e., add, remove, or update multiple items (like hobbies) in a form.
        
    
    ✅ Example use case:  
    You have a form where a user can have **multiple hobbies** — “Reading”, “Swimming”, “Coding” — and you want them to be able to click **“Add Hobby”** to insert new inputs dynamically.




useMutation is reactquery,
UseformBuilder  is  zod.
