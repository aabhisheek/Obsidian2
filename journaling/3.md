Perfect 🔥 — let’s build your **6-month roadmap to becoming a Team Lead**, tailored for someone who’s already a productive developer (like you — doing daily CRUD and features).

We’ll focus on **technical growth + leadership growth** month by month.  
Think of it as _“coding less, leading more — but smarter.”_

## 🧭 6-Month Roadmap to Becoming a Team Lead

### **Month 1: Strengthen Technical Core & Visibility**

**Goal:** Be seen as the most reliable developer on your team.

✅ **Skills & Actions**

- Write **clean, readable, reusable** code.
    
- Ensure **zero reopens** (bug-free and test-covered PRs).
    
- Document all features you work on — even simple CRUDs.
    
- Share progress clearly during stand-ups or Slack updates.
    
- Start reading about **system design basics** (scalability, caching, DB indexing).
    

💡 **Leadership milestone:**  
Your manager/team should start trusting you with “urgent or tricky” tasks.

---

### **Month 2: Ownership & Proactive Mindset**

**Goal:** Move from “assigned tasks” → “self-driven ownership.”

✅ **Skills & Actions**

- Take end-to-end ownership of one feature/module (design → testing → deploy).
    
- Track and close dependencies yourself — don’t wait for others.
    
- Propose at least one **technical improvement** (e.g., API structure, error handling).
    
- Learn **Git branching strategies**, **Jira planning**, and **deployment flow**.
    

💡 **Leadership milestone:**  
Team members and PM start seeing you as the “go-to person” for one key module.

---

### **Month 3: Start Mentoring & Reviewing**

**Goal:** Transition from solo dev → supportive teammate.

✅ **Skills & Actions**

- Begin doing **peer code reviews** — politely but assertively.
    
- Help juniors debug issues or understand project flow.
    
- Document **best practices** (naming, folder structure, REST standards).
    
- Learn **how to estimate** tasks correctly (story points, time planning).
    
- Improve your **communication** — short, clear Slack updates & meeting summaries.
    

💡 **Leadership milestone:**  
You start saving others’ time — mentoring and unblocking them.

---

### **Month 4: Lead Mini-Projects & Improve Architecture Understanding**

**Goal:** Start managing **small projects or subsystems**.

✅ **Skills & Actions**

- Lead a small internal feature or refactor project.
    
- Conduct a mini “technical sync” or share new learnings in team calls.
    
- Deep-dive into your stack’s architecture (e.g., request flow, middleware, DB design).
    
- Learn **design patterns** (Singleton, Factory, Strategy) and **SOLID principles**.
    
- Read about **API versioning**, **logging**, and **monitoring**.
    

💡 **Leadership milestone:**  
Your PM/team starts consulting you for design or estimation decisions.

---

### **Month 5: Start Acting Like a Lead**

**Goal:** Practice leadership before you officially get the title.

✅ **Skills & Actions**

- Plan weekly priorities for your sub-team (or group of tasks).
    
- Review all PRs in your module for code consistency.
    
- Identify **bottlenecks** and propose automation (scripts, CI/CD, testing).
    
- Learn basic **Agile/Scrum rituals** — sprint planning, retrospectives, velocity tracking.
    
- Start learning **soft skills**: giving feedback, conflict resolution, calm communication.
    

💡 **Leadership milestone:**  
Team sees you as the de-facto lead of your feature area. You make small tech decisions independently.

---

### **Month 6: Officially Demonstrate Leadership**

**Goal:** Transition from _acting lead_ → _recognized lead._

✅ **Skills & Actions**

- Present a **demo or improvement project** to management.
    
- Take charge in sprint planning or stand-up facilitation.
    
- Mentor one junior dev more formally (document their learning plan).
    
- Create **technical documentation** or **onboarding guides**.
    
- Learn **how to communicate upward** — status reports, risk handling.
    

💡 **Leadership milestone:**  
Your manager starts referring to you as “module owner” or “team lead material.”  
That’s when promotions or lead nominations naturally happen.

---

## 🧩 Bonus: Optional Skills That Accelerate Leadership

- **GitHub Actions / Jenkins (CI/CD)**
    
- **Basic cloud deployment (AWS, Azure, or GCP)**
    
- **Project management tools (Jira, Asana, Notion)**
    
- **Communication tools mastery (Slack etiquette, meeting skills)**
    
- **Designing scalable systems (for senior-level discussions)**

Would you like me to make a **personalized version of this roadmap** —  
based on your **current stack** (Spring Boot, React, etc.) and your **company role (backend/full-stack)** —  
so it’s 100% actionable with concrete weekly goals?
