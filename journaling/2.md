22nd 


1)  in every scenario,
 have  predefined todays timetable and goals to chase ,
 and long term  defined goals


  also everytime have 3 options 
---if you do best action  what will be your future reality --never follow
--- hybrid it with 20-30 percent random chances, increases your chances/luck   ---bestCase
everything is planned here

and the meduim part , u cant autopilot everything here , still 40 percent effort 
still 20 percent journaling needed here 

and the worst part , if you do everything on autoPilot,worst case




2)  this year end, 
      prabhanjan will fuck you fast skills and lock him in flat , 
      ek moment me chudd jate phir lower spiral ka shikhaar 
      ya phir ek sahi grp aur upward spiral ka phase of 1-2 years , until you get separated

        then people think yar im smart i got succesful.
          shut 1)you took hard work initiative
             2) you get that one friend/wife to whom you extracted all value
             3) 



3) never be in a circle /gym /home where you are praised 
     or is different , have a friend around 
     they distract you from hardwork
     innercircle should always appreciate and tell you to work hard instead of praise
     they should know its result of hardwork





4) life 
school --- mummy plus prabhakar sir 
          mummy saw loophole, started cheating 

then vidyapeeth 


now shakils sir good mentorss

now repeat that agaainn with balanace



6)   full stack developement is just like a big syllabus 
everyday you have a revise a  chunk of data and increase it 
then only 12 lakhs or 5-7 lakhs in year end .

   fast increase -lvl 1
   meduim increase lvl2
   layoff 
because i am not a expereinced candidate.

then complete dsa 1 crore is not a big deal. with 1 year experience.

7) being with madhav and in the right group really helps a lot. everytime 
u had lost this being at Home. now again you have a hang of it 

madhav,hemant chawri , .....




8)     everyday you learn about some new error/topic 
make note and revise it 


3-4
