1)without passing the children props in layout, 

it is not possible to render anything.

there are two main pages to render content in nextjs.

layout.js
page.js

in page.jsx we  have  content which we want to render 

but it cannot be rendered until i pass the children props in layout.jsx

if i define Hello here;

in global layout.jsx

then it will be shown everywhere in everypage , about , normal 

so this is the trick, 
if you want to show the sidebar or navbar which you want available everywhere 

you need to define it here.
